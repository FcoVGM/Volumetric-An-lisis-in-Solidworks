# Volumetric-An-lisis-in-Solidworks

This VBA code functions as a Solidworks Macro and operates through the following steps:

1 - Mesh Generation: It divides the model into even squares, producing a mesh view in the Top View.

2 - Volume Calculation: The code reads and saves the volume contained within each of these squares.

3 - Extrusion Visualization: It extrudes the mesh, representing the percentage of volume within each mesh square relative to the total volume.

4 - Excel Report: The code creates an Excel file that compiles and displays all the volumes for each mesh square.
